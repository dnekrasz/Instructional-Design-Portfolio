<h2>6.1  Overhead: The Cost of a Dollar</h2>

<p>One of the most important  business concepts is that of &ldquo;Overhead.&rdquo; <br />
  </p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with a simple  example. Suppose you run a painting business and you are asked to paint a room  for a client. From your experience, you have a good idea of how long it will  take to paint the room: 6 hours. The question is: How much should you charge  for that 6 hours?<br />
  </p>
<p>First, we have to  understand that there are different types of costs involved:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If  we employ painters, we have to pay benefits (vacation time, sick time, health  insurance costs, etc.) How do we handle these? </li>
  <li>Also,  your business requires an office, which requires rent, electricity, heat, etc.  Maybe you also have administrative staff to schedule the painters. You also  probably have supplies that you keep in storage.</li>
  <li>There  are also corporate expenses, such as your accountant, lawyer, and the company  you pay to process the paychecks, pensions, etc. </li>
  <li>Finally,  there is the profit. </li>
</ul>
<p>All of these have rules and  regulations that you must comply with. Some are chargeable to the project and  some are not. The rules are the same for all industries, so the process we describe  here applies to everyone.</p>



<h2>6.2 The Overhead Calculation</h2>

<p>Suppose we pay one of the painters $1. What do we charge the customer?</p>

<p>The process is as follows:</p>

<ol class="customOl">

	<li>The employee gets paid $1</li>

	<li>Estimate the Fringe Benefits

		<ul class="customUl">

		<li>All companies have a well-defined <strong>benefit plan</strong>, which explains all of the expenses the employer will pay on behalf of the employee. The first line in the <strong>fringe</strong> is vacation expenses. If the employees each receive 2 weeks’ vacation, that is (approximately) 5% of their salary. Therefore, to pay for employee vacations, the employer adds 5% to the amount paid to the employee, which in this case means that $0.05$ is added to the $1. Similarly, the sick pay adds another 5%.</li>

The largest employer contribution is the <strong>health care plan</strong>. This can be anywhere for 20% to 40% of the <strong>labor cost</strong>. In this example, we used 34%.</p>

		<li>Therefore, the <strong>total fringe</strong> is $0.50. The company then calculates the percentage fringes (of the DL), which in this case is $0.50 / $1.0 = 50%.</li>

		<li>In reality, different employees have slightly different fringe costs. Say that senior employees have more vacation. The company estimates the total fringe cost for all employees for the year. The company also estimates the <strong>total labor cost</strong> for the company for the year. Then the fringe percent is calculated. The process, however, is identical to the Fringe calculation in <em>Table 1</em>.</li>

<h2>6.3 The Overhead Rate</h2>

<p>The result of the overhead calculation is the establishment of the <strong>overhead rate</strong> for the upcoming year. The result is the percentages.</p>

<p>For example, a project manager estimates that it will take $10,000 of labor. Therefore, the bid would be:</p>

<table class="table2 data centertable">
<caption>Table 2: Bid rate from overhead percentages</caption>
 	<tr>
   		<td>Direct Labor (DL)</td>
   		<td>$10,000</td>
 	</tr>
 	<tr>
   		<td>Fringe (35% of DL)</td>
   		<td>$3,500</td>
 	</tr>
 	<tr>
   		<td style="text-align: right; padding-right: 1em;">DL+Fr</td>
   		<td>$13,500</td>
 	</tr>
 	<tr>
   		<td>Overhead (100% of DL+Fr)</td>
   		<td>$13,500</td>
 	</tr>
 	<tr>
   		<td style="text-align: right; padding-right: 1em;">DL+Fr+Ov</td>
   		<td>$27,000</td>
 	</tr>
 	<tr>
   		<td>G&amp;A (15% of DL+Fr+Ov)</td>
   		<td>$4,050</td>
 	</tr>
 	<tr>
   		<td style="text-align: right; padding-right: 1em;">DL+Fr+Ov+G&amp;A</td>
   		<td>$31,050</td>
 	</tr>
 	<tr>
   		<td>Total Cost</td>
   		<td>$31,050</td>
 	</tr>
 	<tr>
   		<td style="padding-right: 2em;">Profit (20% of DL+Fr+Ov+G&amp;A)</td>
   		<td>$6,210</td>
 	</tr>
 	<tr>
   		<td>Total Bid</td>
   		<td>$37,260</td>
 	</tr>
</table>

<p>To support $10,000 of actual payments to staff, the bid should be $37,260.</p>

<p>The multiplier from the labor cost of $10,000 to the final number of $37,260 is 3.73. That means you charge a customer $3.73 for each dollar of labor that you pay to an employee. This is sometimes called the overhead rate, which is slightly confusing as the overhead also comes after the fringe, as indicated in <em>Table 2</em>.</p>

<p>There are a couple of other issues yet to be resolved.</p>



<h3>6.3.1 Other Direct Costs (ODCs)</h3>

<p>A number of other types of costs can occur, e.g., subcontractors and travel. If you decide to add a subcontractor, who bids $10,000, you would change <em>Table 1</em> as follows:</p>

<table class="table2 data centertable">
	<caption>Table 3: Bid rate including a subcontractor ODC</caption>
 	<tr>
  		<td>Direct Labor (DL)</td>
  		<td>$10,000</td>
 	</tr>
 	<tr>
  		<td>Fringe (35% of DL)</td>
  		<td>$3,500</td>
 	</tr>
 	<tr>
  	<td style="text-align: right; padding-right: 1em;">DL+Fr</td>
  		<td>$13,500</td>
 	</tr>
 	<tr>
  		<td>Overhead (100% of DL+Fr)</td>
  		<td>$13,500</td>
 	</tr>
 	<tr>
  	<td style="text-align: right; padding-right: 1em;">DL+Fr+Ov</td>
  		<td>$27,000</td>
 	</tr>
 	<tr>
  		<td>G&amp;A (15% of DL+Fr+Ov)</td>
  		<td>$4,050</td>
 	</tr>
 	<tr>
  	<td style="text-align: right; padding-right: 1em;">DL+Fr+Ov+G&amp;A</td>
  		<td>$31,050</td>
 	</tr>
 	<tr>
  		<td>ODC: Subcontractor</td>
  		<td>$10,000</td>
 	</tr>
 	<tr>
  		<td>G&amp;A on ODC (15%)</td>
  		<td>$1,500</td>
 	</tr>
 	<tr>
  		<td>Total Cost</td>
  		<td>$42,550</td>
 	</tr>
 	<tr>
  	<td style="padding-right: 2em;">Profit (20% of DL+Fr+Ov+G&amp;A)</td>
  		<td>$8,510</td>
 	</tr>
 	<tr>
  		<td>Total Bid</td>
  		<td>$51,060</td>
 	</tr>
</table>

<p>Contractors are added after the company’s bid. You are allowed to add G&amp;A to the contractor’s bid. This is because G&amp;A pays for the sorts of activities that are associated with managing a subcontractor: bills and payments, legal contractual issues, etc. You are also allowed to make a profit on the contractor’s bid. (Presumably, they made a profit also!)</p>

<p><strong>Travel costs</strong> would also be considered as ODC. Suppose you agreed to meet with the customer once a month. You could include the travel to the customer in your bid. Like a subcontractor, it would go in the ODC category.</p>

<p>If you ran into a problem and visited the customer for a second time within the month, the customer may not agree to pay for that travel. In which case, your company would have to pay for the travel. Where would it come from? The only place it can come from is the profit.</p>

<p>This is an example of an <strong>unallowable expense</strong>. These are expenses that the customer refuses to pay. In government contracts (local, city, state, and federal), there are volumes of regulations about what is, and is not, allowable, i.e., chargeable to the contract. Alcoholic drinks are an example of an unallowable charge.</p>



<h3>6.3.2  Nonprofits</h3>

<p>Many organizations are nonprofits. These include universities, theaters, opera and dance companies, museums, some hospitals, and charities. These companies still need to calculate their overhead rate; the only difference is that they do not add the profit.</p>



<h3>6.3.3 Auditing the Overhead Rate</h3>

<p>The overhead rate is obviously a sensitive issue as it lists things like salaries and benefits. A lower overhead rate results in a lower bid, and so it is also a competitive weapon. How does one balance the need for secrecy in the details with cost transparency? The process is as follows.

<p>Each year, the previous year’s overhead is audited to ensure that all costs are legitimate. At the same time, the next year’s rate is proposed and audited. The audit is confidential and the details are not disclosed.



<h3>6.3.4 Direct and Indirect Costs</h3>

<p><strong>Direct costs</strong> are chargeable to the project. These include all the categories above: fringe, overhead, G&A, and, if allowable, profit (fee).

<p>As in travel expenses, there are allowable and non-allowable expenses in each of the above categories. In general, direct costs are the costs that are clearly chargeable to the project. (They are usually allocated to a specific work package in the WBS.) If your company sends you on a one-week training course, that would probably not be chargeable to the project. The customer would likely argue that training is designed to make you a better employee and the project may not see a direct benefit. This would then be allocated as an <strong>indirect cost</strong>.

<p>For example, if your company institutes a policy of standardizing on WordPress but the project does not use it; a training course in WordPress cannot reasonably argued to be a direct cost, in which case it is assigned as an indirect cost. Other indirect expenses include departments such as marketing. These expenses are not related to the current contract but are the costs of seeking the next project.

<p>What pays for indirect costs? The only place it can come from is the Profit.



<h2>6.4 Estimating Sales</h2>

<p>W&amp;K Table 11.6, section 11.8, is a detailed example that calculates the overhead rate for a small beer company. It follows exactly the same process as above. The result is that the first year’s expenses are estimated at $374,000.

<p>To pay all those expenses, you need a <strong>sales force</strong>. The sales department estimated they could sell 20,000 cases at $30.00 each, or $600,000. The cost of beer-making supplies is $200,000. This leaves $400,000 to pay the expenses. Because this figure is greater than the expense, things look good.

<p>What happens if the sales fall below that estimate? All of the expenses still have to be paid, and you end up with a loss. If, after a few months, it appears that the beer company is not going to make its sales target, there is only one recourse: get rid of staff. All the other expenses are necessary (the space and equipment).
